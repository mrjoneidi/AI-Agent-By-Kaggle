Drug discovery is one of the areas where AI is making the most profound and rapid advancements. Here are some of the new developments and key trends:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n*   **Beyond Screening:** Instead of just screening existing libraries of compounds, generative AI models (like variations of GANs, VAEs, and increasingly, diffusion models and LLMs adapted for molecular structures) are now capable of **designing entirely new molecules from scratch**. These models learn the underlying rules of chemistry and biology to propose molecules with desired properties, such as high binding affinity to a specific target or favorable pharmacokinetic profiles.\n*   **Targeted Design:** Researchers can guide these generative models by specifying desired characteristics, such as solubility, permeability, or a lack of toxicity, allowing for more efficient and targeted design.\n\n**2. AlphaFold and Protein Structure Prediction:**\n*   While not strictly \"new\" (AlphaFold was released in late 2020/early 2021), its impact continues to grow. DeepMind's AlphaFold can predict the 3D structure of proteins with unprecedented accuracy.\n*   **Implications for Drug Discovery:** Knowing a protein's structure is crucial for designing drugs that can bind to it and modulate its function.

Here's a deeper dive:\n\n**What is AlphaFold?**\n\nAlphaFold is an artificial intelligence system developed by DeepMind (a Google subsidiary). Its primary breakthrough is its ability to predict the **3D structure of proteins from their amino acid sequence with remarkable accuracy**.\n\n**Why is Protein Structure So Important?**\n\nProteins are the workhorses of our cells. They perform a vast array of functions:\n\n*   **Enzymes:** Catalyzing biochemical reactions.\n*   **Antibodies:** Fighting infections.\n*   **Receptors:** Receiving signals.\n*   **Structural components:** Providing support to cells and tissues.\n\nThe **function of a protein is intimately linked to its 3D shape**. Think of it like a key fitting into a lock. If you don't know the shape of the lock (the protein), it's very hard to design a key that fits it (a drug molecule).\n\n**The Challenge of Protein Folding:**\n\nFor decades, determining a protein's 3D structure experimentally was a difficult, time-consuming, and expensive process. Techniques like X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) require purified proteins and can take months or even years to yield results for a single protein. This meant that the structures of only a fraction of the millions of proteins in the biological world were known.\n\n**How AlphaFold Works (Simplified):**\n\nAlphaFold uses deep learning, specifically a type of neural network architecture that is good at understanding relationships between parts of a sequence. It takes the linear sequence of amino acids that make up a protein and predicts how they will fold into a complex 3D structure. It considers:\n\n*   **Amino acid sequences:** The basic building blocks.\n*   **Evolutionary information:** Similar sequences in other organisms often fold similarly, providing clues.\n*   **Physical and geometric constraints:** The laws of physics that govern how molecules interact.\n\n**The Impact on Drug Discovery:**\n\nThis is where AlphaFold becomes incredibly relevant to the topic of drug discovery:\n\n1.  **Target Identification:**\n    *   **Knowing the Target:** Before AlphaFold, identifying potential drug targets (often disease-causing proteins) was a major hurdle, especially if their structure wasn't known. Now, researchers can quickly obtain highly accurate structural models for a vast number of potential targets.\n    *   **Understanding Disease Mechanisms:** Studying the structure of a disease-related protein can reveal how it malfunctions, providing insights into the disease itself and how it might be intervened upon.\n\n2.  **Rational Drug Design:**\n    *   **\"Structure-Based Drug Design\":** This is a cornerstone of modern drug discovery. Once you have the 3D structure of a target protein, you can computationally design or screen molecules that are shaped to bind specifically to a critical site on that protein (e.g., an active site of an enzyme or a binding pocket).\n    *   **Improved Binding Affinity:** Knowing the precise contours of the target protein allows for the design of drug molecules that fit more snugly, leading to stronger and more effective binding.\n    *   **Reduced Off-Target Effects:** By designing molecules that are highly specific to the intended target's unique structure, researchers can reduce the likelihood of the drug binding to other proteins and causing unwanted side effects.\n\n3.  **Accelerated Research and Development:**\n    *   **Democratization of Structural Biology:** AlphaFold makes high-quality structural information accessible to researchers worldwide, regardless of their access to expensive experimental equipment. This speeds up the research pipeline significantly.\n    *   **Faster Hypothesis Generation:** Scientists can quickly generate hypotheses about protein function and drug interactions based on predicted structures.\n\n4.  **Understanding Protein Variants and Mutations:**\n    *   **Impact of Genetic Changes:** Genetic mutations can alter a protein's sequence, potentially changing its structure and function. AlphaFold can help predict how these mutations might affect protein folding and, consequently, lead to disease. This is crucial for understanding inherited diseases and developing personalized medicines.\n\n**Beyond Drug Discovery:**\n\nWhile drug discovery is a major beneficiary, AlphaFold's impact extends to:\n\n*   **Understanding fundamental biology:** Unraveling the roles of proteins in cellular processes.\n*   **Enzyme engineering:** Designing enzymes for industrial applications (e.g., in biofuels or manufacturing).\n*   **Vaccine development:** Understanding the structure of viral proteins to design more effective vaccines.\n\n**Availability and Further Developments:**\n\nDeepMind has made the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database publicly available, containing predictions for millions of proteins. This has been a game-changer. There are also ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy, expand the capabilities (e.g., predicting protein complexes, protein-ligand interactions), and make these tools even more user-friendly.\n\nIn essence, AlphaFold has provided a powerful new lens through which to view the molecular machinery of life, dramatically accelerating our ability to understand proteins and, consequently, to design medicines that interact with them.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  It's important to clarify that **AlphaFold itself is a specific AI model developed by DeepMind**.

They often focus on specific diseases or therapeutic modalities and can leverage AlphaFold to accelerate their early-stage research.\n\n*   **AI-Driven Drug Discovery Companies:**\n    *   These companies are explicitly built around using AI (including structural prediction from tools like AlphaFold) as a core component of their drug discovery process. Examples include:\n        *   **Exscientia:** Uses AI for drug design and discovery.\n        *   **Insilico Medicine:** Utilizes AI for target discovery, drug design, and clinical development.\n        *   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Maps human cellular biology with AI to discover drugs.\n        *   **Atomwise:** Specializes in using deep learning for small molecule drug discovery.\n        *   **Cerebras Systems** (though more of a hardware provider, they enable AI research): Develops specialized AI hardware that is used by drug discovery companies.\n\n*   **Academic Institutions and Research Labs:**\n    *   Universities and public research institutions globally are using AlphaFold extensively. Researchers use it to study fundamental biological questions, identify novel drug targets, and publish their findings, often collaborating with or spinning out companies. The **European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)** is a key partner in hosting and curating the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database.\n\n*   **Structural Biology and Bioinformatics Service Providers:**\n    *   Some companies offer services to help other organizations interpret and utilize protein structure data, including predictions from AlphaFold, in their drug discovery workflows.\n\n**Key takeaway:**\n\nWhile DeepMind and Google are the originators of AlphaFold, the **companies and institutions that are *applying* these structural predictions to find new medicines are incredibly diverse and numerous**. They range from the largest pharmaceutical giants to innovative AI-native biotech startups and academic research groups.\n\nThe availability of AlphaFold has essentially leveled the playing field, providing a powerful tool that can be used by virtually anyone with access to its database and the scientific expertise to interpret the results.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.3 Verifying Compaction in the Session History\n\nThe conversation above looks normal, but the history has been changed behind the scenes.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
