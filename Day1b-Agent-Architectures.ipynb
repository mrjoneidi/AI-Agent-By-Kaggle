Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Another night, much like any other. Then, a glint from the dusty floorboards near the old sea chest. He knelt, his fingers brushing against something smooth and cool. It was a rolled parchment, tied with a thread that hummed with faint light. Unfurling it, Elias gasped. Not paper, but some unknown, leathery material, it displayed a map, shimmering with an inner luminescence. Strange symbols pulsed, detailing a coastline he’d never seen, and a single, burning X marked a point far beyond known shipping lanes.

Is he purely excited, or is there a hint of fear, skepticism, or even dread given the map's unusual nature and its unknown destination? Showing more of his internal conflict or contemplation would add depth.\n2.  **Hint at the map's potential origin or purpose:** The map is described as being on an \"unknown, leathery material\" with \"strange symbols.\" While keeping it mysterious is good, a subtle hint could enhance the intrigue. For example, perhaps the thread humming with light has a specific, almost familiar texture, or the symbols bear a faint resemblance to something Elias has seen or heard of in obscure maritime lore. This would give the reader something more to ponder about the map's origins without giving away too much.\nRefinerAgent > Elias traced the salt-crusted rim of his mug, the lighthouse beam sweeping its steady rhythm across the churning sea. Another night, much like any other, the endless cycle of light and dark, the gnawing solitude his only companion. Then, a glint from the dusty floorboards near the old sea chest, a flicker that snagged his attention. He knelt, his fingers brushing against something smooth and cool, alien to the rough-hewn wood. It was a rolled parchment, tied with a thread that hummed with faint, otherworldly light, a light that seemed to pulse in time with his own quickening heartbeat. Unfurling it, Elias gasped. Not paper, but some unknown, leathery material, supple yet resilient, it displayed a map, shimmering with an inner luminescence. Strange symbols, like no script he’d ever encountered, pulsed with an inner fire, detailing a coastline he’d never seen, and a single, burning X marked a point far beyond known shipping lanes. The beam swung, and for a moment, the map seemed to absorb and then reflect its light, the X flaring with an impossible intensity. A thrill shot through Elias, sharp and exhilarating, quickly followed by a cold tendril of fear. This was no ordinary chart; it whispered of forgotten depths, of places men were not meant to find. Skepticism warred with a burgeoning sense of destiny. The thread, he noticed, felt strangely familiar, like scales shed from some ancient leviathan, a texture whispered about in hushed tones by old sailors recounting impossible tales. Could this be from one of those forgotten voyages, a remnant of a world lost to the waves and time? The map pulsed again, the X a siren’s call, and Elias felt a dangerous, exhilarating spark ignite within him, a profound pull towards the unknown, a longing he hadn't realized lay dormant in his solitary heart.\nCriticAgent > The story successfully establishes a strong atmosphere and introduces a compelling mystery. Elias's character, though simple, serves well as the focal point for the unfolding events. The pacing is effective in building intrigue and capturing Elias's discovery.\n\nHere are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Enhance the sensory details of the map:** While the luminescence and pulsing are good, consider adding other sensory details. What does the \"unknown, leathery material\" *smell* like? Does it have a unique texture beyond being \"smooth and cool\"? Does it make a sound when unfurled or pulsed? Adding more specific, tangible details can make the map feel even more real and otherworldly.\n2.  **Show, don't just tell, Elias's inner conflict:** Phrases like \"Skepticism warred with a burgeoning sense of destiny\" are good indicators, but showing Elias physically reacting to this internal struggle would be more impactful. For example, does he clench his jaw, his hand tremble as he reaches for the map, or does he look around the familiar lighthouse as if seeking reassurance before committing to this unknown path?\n3.  **Connect the \"faint, otherworldly light\" of the thread more directly to the map's symbols or luminescence:** The thread is described as humming with light that pulses with Elias's heartbeat. Later, the symbols on the map pulse with \"inner fire\" and the X flares with \"impossible intensity.\" A stronger connection or a mirroring of these light qualities between the thread and the map's markings could create a more cohesive magical element.\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
